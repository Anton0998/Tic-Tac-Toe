# Tic Tac Toe Web App

## Introduction

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe web application built with React. The app allows users to play Tic Tac Toe against another player in a turn-based grid layout. It follows the classic rules of the 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board.

Features include:
- Players can enter their names before starting the game.
- Player 1 plays as 'X' and Player 2 plays as 'O'.
- A turn tracker indicates whose turn it is.
- After each round, the winner is announced, and the game can be reset.
- Once there's a winner, the game stops, and players' victory counts are updated.

The application can be extended to save victories across sessions using localStorage.

## Tools

This application was built using the following tools:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**: For styling the app and ensuring a responsive, modern UI.
